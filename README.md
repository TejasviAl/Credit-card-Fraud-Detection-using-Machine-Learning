# Credit-card-Fraud-Detection-using-Machine-Learning
This project applies **machine learning** to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using the kaggle dataset(https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud). Fraudulent transactions are very rare (&lt;1% of total), so this project shows how to build models that can **learn from imbalanced datasets** and still detect fraud effectively.
