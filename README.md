# Credit-card-Fraud-Detection-using-Machine-Learning
This project applies **machine learning** to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using the kaggle dataset(https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud). Fraudulent transactions are very rare (&lt;1% of total), so this project shows how to build models that can **learn from imbalanced datasets** and still detect fraud effectively.  
**Technology**:
- **Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, XGBoost
**Model**:
1. **Logistic Regression** → simple baseline model.  
2. **Random Forest** → ensemble model, better performance.  
3. **XGBoost** → advanced boosting model widely used in fraud detection.
